# Unweave Textual Inversion Starter

This starter will help you to run [Textual Inversion](https://github.com/rinongal/textual_inversion) on Unweave.

## Run the starter on Unweave

1. If you don't have the Unweave CLI installed, you can get it from homebrew:

```bash
brew install unweave/unweave/unweave
````

2. Use the CLI to login, following the login flow in your browser.

```bash
‚ùØ unweave login
? Do you want to open the browser to login? (Y/n)
```

3. Clone this repository and cd into this Time Sequence Prediction starter directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unweave/starters.git
cd textual-inversion 
```

4. Initialise the directory with unweave and hit enter to name the project after the current directory name.

```bash
‚ùØ unweave init
? Enter project name [textual-inversion]:
Created project textual-inversion
Path:    	/Users/markwinter/Code/starters/textual-inversion
Project: 	textual-inversion
```

5. Download an image set from the authors found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d2UXkX0GWM-4qUwThjNhFIPP7S6WUbQJ). You should then upload the images to your uwstore so they are available to your zepls without uploading them every time you start a zepl.

```bash
# Download an image set from the google drive link and unzip it to a directory.
# If you used the thin_bird dataset and unzipped it, you woud upload it like below
‚ùØ unweave store upload ~/Downloads/thin_bird
```

6. Run the main python script with the Unweave CLI. This will create a serverless compute node (`zepl`) with your data and run it. **This requires access to GPU zepls. If you need access please contact us.**

```bash
‚ùØ unweave --gpu python main.py -- --base configs/latent-diffusion/txt2img-1p4B-finetune.yaml -t --actual_resume ./uwstore/data/model.ckpt -n test --gpus 0, --data_root ./uwstore/data/thin_bird --init_word sculpture --no-test --logdir ./uwstore/output
Created zepl "wooden-dish-most-sea" with ID "52bf79f0-643d-4d6c-b4e6-6ecbef3c9315"
