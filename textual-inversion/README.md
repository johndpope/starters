# Unweave Textual Inversion Starter

This starter will help you to run [Textual Inversion](https://github.com/rinongal/textual_inversion) on Unweave.

## Run the starter on Unweave

1. If you don't have the Unweave CLI installed, you can get it from homebrew:

```bash
brew install unweave/unweave/unweave
````

2. Use the CLI to login, following the login flow in your browser.

```bash
‚ùØ unweave login
? Do you want to open the browser to login? (Y/n)
```

3. Clone this repository and cd into this Time Sequence Prediction starter directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unweave/starters.git
cd textual-inversion 
```

4. Initialise the directory with unweave and hit enter to name the project after the current directory name.

```bash
‚ùØ unweave init
? Enter project name [textual-inversion]:
Created project textual-inversion
Path:    	/Users/markwinter/Code/starters/textual-inversion
Project: 	textual-inversion
```

5. Download an image set from the authors found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d2UXkX0GWM-4qUwThjNhFIPP7S6WUbQJ). You should then upload the images to your uwstore so they are available to your zepls without uploading them every time you start a zepl.

```bash
# Download an image set from the google drive link and unzip it to a directory.
# If you used the thin_bird dataset and unzipped it, you woud upload it like below
‚ùØ unweave store upload ~/Downloads/thin_bird
```

6. The first step is to run the main python script to invert an image set. We will run the python script using the unweave CLI. This will create a serverless compute node (`zepl`) with your data and run it. **This requires access to GPU zepls. If you need access please contact us.**

```bash
‚ùØ unweave --gpu python main.py -- --base configs/latent-diffusion/txt2img-1p4B-finetune.yaml -t --actual_resume ./uwstore/data/model.ckpt -n test --gpus 0, --data_root ./uwstore/data/thin_bird --init_word sculpture --no-test --logdir ./uwstore/output
Created zepl "wooden-dish-most-sea" with ID "52bf79f0-643d-4d6c-b4e6-6ecbef3c9315"

üßπ Cleaning up
‚úÖ Zepl complete
```

7. Once the zepl is complete, we can get the embedding files from the uwstore using the unweave CLI. This will download all the files in the checkpoints directory to your computer. 

```bash
‚ùØ unweave store download output/<zepl-id>/<textual-run-name>/checkpoints/
```

8. We will need to use one of these embedding files for the next step. Pick one and upload it to your uwstore.

```bash
‚ùØ unweave store upload uwstore/output/<zepl-id>/<textual-run-name>/checkpoints/embeddings_gs-6099.pt
Uploading file embeddings_gs-6099.pt Uploaded!
```

8. The second step is to generate new images. We will run the main python script again using the unweave CLI with the following arguments.

```bash
‚ùØ unweave python scripts/txt2img.py -- --ddim_eta 0.0 --n_samples 8 --n_iter 2 --scale 10.0 --ddim_steps 50 --embedding_path ./uwstore/data/embeddings_gs-6099.pt --ckpt_path ./uwstore/data/model.ckpt --prompt "a photo of sculpture" --outdir ./uwstore/output
```
