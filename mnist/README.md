# Unweave MNIST Starter

This starter will help you train an MNIST model using Unweave and serverless infra.

This MNIST code is taken from the official [PyTorch examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples) where you can find more examples to try running with Unweave.

## Run the starter on Unweave

1. If you don't have Unweave CLI installed, you can get it from homebrew

```bash
$ brew install unweave/unweave/unweave
==> Downloading ...
````

2. Use the Unweave CLI to login, following the login flow in your browser.

```bash
$ unweave login
? Do you want to open the browser to login? (Y/n)
```

3. Clone this repository and cd into this MNIST starter directory

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/unweave/starters.git
$ cd mnist
```

4. Initialise the directory with unweave and call this project `mnist-starter`

```bash
$ unweave init
? Enter project name [mnist]: mnist-starter
Created project mnist-starter
Path:    	/Users/markwinter/Code/starters/mnist
Project: 	mnist-starter
```

5. Run the training script with the Unweave CLI. This will create a serverless compute node (`zepl`) with your data and run it.

```bash
$ unweave python main.py
Executing command 'python main.py' in serverless zepl. Press Ctrl+C to cancel
Executing...

Created zepl "donkey-lie-poet-other" with ID "a5825ccc-9c83-4bb8-84a0-f16801ffaba1"

Starting zepl. Press Ctrl+C while it is running to cancel the run

6. Your MNIST training is complete! You can explore more helpful CLI commands

```bash
# Open the Unweave dashboard in your browser
$ unweave open
```

```bash
# Check the logs of a zepl
$ unweave logs <zepl-id>
```

```bash
# Check all your zepls
$ unweave zepls
```

```bash
# Run a zepl but immediately detach once it has successfully launched
$ unweave -d python main.py
```
