# Unweave Time Sequence Prediction Starter

This starter will help you train an Time Sequence Prediction model using Unweave and serverless infra.

This Time Sequence Prediction code is taken from the official [PyTorch examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples) where you can find more examples to try running with Unweave.

## Run the starter on Unweave

1. If you don't have the Unweave CLI installed, you can get it from homebrew:

```bash
brew install unweave/unweave/unweave
````

2. Use the CLI to login, following the login flow in your browser.

```bash
❯ unweave login
? Do you want to open the browser to login? (Y/n)
```

3. Clone this repository and cd into this Time Sequence Prediction starter directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unweave/starters.git
cd time-sequence-prediction 
```

4. Initialise the directory with unweave and hit enter to name the project after the current directory name.

```bash
❯ unweave init
? Enter project name [time-sequence-prediction]:
Created project time-sequence-prediction
Path:    	/Users/markwinter/Code/starters/time-sequence-prediction
Project: 	time-sequence-prediction
```

5. Run the training script with the Unweave CLI. This will create a serverless compute node (`zepl`) with your data and run it.

```bash
❯ unweave python train.py
Created zepl "wooden-dish-most-sea" with ID "52bf79f0-643d-4d6c-b4e6-6ecbef3c9315"

Starting zepl
Press Ctrl+C to cancel the zepl
Press Ctrl+D to detach
